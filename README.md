# Load Framework

This framework helps you to importing other html files in your html file

# Installation

**_Note: This framework requires jQuery to load html. You don't need to import jQuery, framework will automatically load the jquery._**

Add a script tag to your html file
```html
<script src="https://shamyakgoel.github.io/loadframework/load.js"></script>
```
This will load both framework and jQuery<br>
**_Note: If you already have jQuery in your website, this will not import jQuery._**
