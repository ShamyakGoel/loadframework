Add a script tag to your html file
```html
<script src="https://https://shamyakgoel.github.io/loadframework/load.js"></script>
```

**_Note: If you already have jQuery in your website, this will not import jQuery._**

# Usage

<load from="path/to/your/html/file"/>
```

And file will be loaded and a div element is automatically created and its inner html will be contents of your html file
